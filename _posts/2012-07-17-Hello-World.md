## **Hello!**

My name is Jonathan Southern, and thanks for even checking out my blog in the first place. I don't want to ramble too much about programming as the whole other 98% of this site will talk about it, so I will indulge you in a bit of my personal life.

#### Huge Car Fanatic

While I'm not reviewing pull requests or smashing away at  keyboards, I enjoy working on cars. While I do enjoy doing some mentally taxing work, I also enjoy balancing out my tears working physically. Growing up my father would take me cruising around in his Miata and would introduce to a bunch of great car television, such as Top Gear (*UK version only of course).* I then took his love for cars and bought a Miata as my first car, just as he did.

In a lot of ways, working on a car is very similar to programming. Debugging an issue with a car is met with a series of questions like coding. For example, I first try to see if the issue is reproduceable. Then I follow a "stack trace", but in car version. Then I proceed to go on ~~stack overflow~~ the Miata forum to read a whole list of possible solutions/issues.

If you're even more curious about the car, you can look at the personal blog I have built for it on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brilliantblackmiata/?hl=en).
